This post lists the shortcuts available in **Relaxing Clock**. It will be updated alongside the app. Some shortcuts will be shown on screen while so they might no be present in this article.

## Quick-launch for the "Command box"
`Alt + R`: Create a reminder  
`Alt + T`: Search a song in Spotify  
`Alt + M`: Search a playlist in Spotify  
`Alt + L`: Search all matching the query in Spotify  
`Alt + Shift + P`: Create a new pinned message  
`Alt + A`: Set the alarm  

## Playback
`Space`, anywhere in the app: Play/Pause the current song  

### While you are searching for a song
`Ctrl + Enter`: Adds the selected song to the queue  
`Ctrl + Shift + Enter`: Plays the selected song immediately, but doesn't break the queue (like if you are playing an album the next song after the one you select will be a song of the album)  

## Gestures
- **Swipe horizonally**, *if you have a trackpad*, to switch the style of the clock
- **Long press the hours number** to make it grow!  
PS: you can see it shaking when you hover it.
- **Right click on the hours number** to change its color!

## Watch the DOTS!
If you see a ***colored DOT*** under the clock, hover on it to see what is going on. They indicate an incoming event, a running timer or a pending alarm.  
You can click on them, and they will bring you to the correct spot.
